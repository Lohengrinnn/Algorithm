candidate rectangles:
0-6 * 1
3-6 * 2
4-5 * 3

monotonic stack: record index, height of which is smallest one bigger than prev height. h[i] can be heigh of candidate rectangle.
each step operation:
1.if h[i] is higher than prev, just push the 'i'.
2.if h[i] is smaller or equal than prev, pop all bigger one, push i, to abide by the law, i is smllest one bigger than prev.
 1) all bigger than i is poped, so prev will be smaller than h[i]
 2) h[i] is the smallest, because h[i]'s prevs poped is prev smallest, than which h[i] is even smaller.

example:
0           
01          
2           1*3
