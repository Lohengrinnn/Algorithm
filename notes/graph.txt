1. DFS:
color: WHITE, GREY, BLACK
d/f: discover time, finish time

2. BFS:
d: depth
Ï€: parent

3. cycle detection:
   When access a GREY vertex, means descendant visits predecessor.
   or access a vertex with discover time is not 0, finish time is 0, which means the vertex is GREY.

4. topological sort:
   cycle test:
   DFS: go over topic 3.
   BFS: after remove points and edges of points which have indegree == 0, still leave sevral vertex with non-zero indegree.

5. ***********************************************************************
   *   NEVER FORGET: when create edges for vertices in undirected gragh  *
   *   [u, v] -> {u : v} and !!!!!!!!!!! don't forget {v : u}            *

6. SCC: Strong Connected Components
   Articulation Point
   Bridge
   Biconnected graph
   
   These are related topics of graphic.
   Articulation point is an point connected self SCC, and other SCC.(Precisely, when the point itself is a SCC, and only onnect to one neighbor, it's a termination point, not an articulation point)
   Bridge is an edge connect two SCCs, if there are more than one brighe to connect two SCCs, the two SCCs in fact belong to one SCC.
   Biconnected gragh is a kind of SCC.
