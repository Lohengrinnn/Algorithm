1. DFS:
color: WHITE, GREY, BLACK
d/f: discover time, finish time

2. BFS:
d: depth
Ï€: parent

3. cycle detection:
   When access a GREY vertex, means descendant visits predecessor.
   or access a vertex with discover time is not 0, finish time is 0, which means the vertex is GREY.

4. topological sort:
   cycle test:
   DFS: go over topic 3.
   BFS: after remove points and edges of points which have indegree == 0, still leave sevral vertex with non-zero indegree.
