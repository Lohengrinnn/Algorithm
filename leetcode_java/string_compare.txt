String string1 = "A";
String string2 = "A";
String string3 = new String("A");
  
assertThat(string1 == string2).isTrue();
assertThat(string1 == string3).isFalse();
the first assertion is true because the two variables point to the same String.

On the other hand, the second assertion is false because string1 is created with a literal and string3 is created using the new operator â€“ therefore they reference different objects.


using equals will walk around this problem, once content of two strings are the same the return val is true.
