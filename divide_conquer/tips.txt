1. after binary search, the result of search should be checked, since the cursor might be overflowed, if it didn't find a proper position inside the array.
   for example:
   search a rotated sorted array:
   [3, 4, 5, 1, 2] l cursor will be 3 
   find the first num which is smaller than the first one
   if the array rotated by 0
   [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] l cursor will be 5, which is exceed the right bound.
