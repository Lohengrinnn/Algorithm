Generally speaking, there are 2 types of divide (& conquer) pattern, which differ from each other with termination condition
1)
   while l < r:          l < r: means if l meets r, terminate.
       m = partition()
       if xxxx:
           l = m + 1
       else:
           r = m - 1
2) 
   while l <= r:         l <= r: means if l meets r, need to do one more search
       m = l + (r - l) // 2
       if xxxx:
           l = m + 1
       else:
           r = m - 1

pattern 1: quick sort
pattern 2: binary search in sorted array

For the pattern 1, the m is a pivot, used to divide with l and r. if l == r, means this half has only one element, for the sake of sort, no need to process, but if the purposes is search, still need to process it.
For the pattern 2, as decribed above, when l == r, still need to process the last one element.
